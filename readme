These shell scripts, when combined with their corresponding config.xml files will:

1) Download and Install WebObjects in HUDSON_HOME/WOFrameworksRepository/WebObjects/

2) Clone, Build and Install the Wonder Frameworks in HUDSON_HOME/WOFrameworksRepository/ProjectWOnder

3) Link required WebObjects and Project Wonder frameworks to your Job's Workspace instead of copying them there (much faster)

4) Build your WebObjects Framework or Application

5) Deploy you WebObjects Application to a remote server running Wonder's JavaMonitor and wotaskd.
